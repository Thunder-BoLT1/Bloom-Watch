# BloomWatch Dashboard Comprehensive Enhancement TODO

## Overview
Implement a full-featured BloomWatch dashboard with NASA Earthdata integration, predictive modeling, and comprehensive analytics as per the design specifications.

## Core Sections to Implement

### 1. Header / Overview Section
- [ ] Title & Branding: "BloomWatch – Global Flowering Phenology"
- [ ] Quick Stats Cards:
  - Current global bloom hotspots (from satellite NDVI)
  - Avg. NDVI index today
  - Next predicted bloom peak
  - Number of regions monitored
- [ ] Global Search: Select country/region by name or coordinates

### 2. Interactive Global Map
- [ ] Base Layer: NASA GIBS / Landsat / MODIS / VIIRS satellite imagery
- [ ] Overlay Options (toggle layers):
  - Vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI)
  - Current bloom detection (highlighted zones)
  - Bloom trends over time (animated slider)
  - Citizen science inputs (from GLOBE App)
- [ ] Features:
  - Zoom in/out to regional or local scale
  - Click location → show bloom timeline
  - Compare before/after bloom season with swipe tool

### 3. Time-Series & Analytics Section
- [ ] Charts:
  - NDVI/EVI trends (monthly, yearly)
  - Bloom cycle curve (first bloom, peak bloom, end bloom)
  - Climate correlations (temperature, rainfall vs. blooming)
- [ ] Filters:
  - Select plant type
  - Select region
  - Choose time range (e.g., last 5 years)
- [ ] Insights:
  - Bloom peak shift analysis
  - Year-to-year comparisons

### 4. Predictive Modeling Section
- [ ] Forecast Panel:
  - Predicted next bloom date for selected region
  - Confidence interval
  - Graph overlay: Actual vs Predicted NDVI
- [ ] ML Model Info:
  - Model used (LSTM, Random Forest, etc.)
  - Performance metrics (RMSE, accuracy)
- [ ] Scenario Simulation:
  - Adjust future climate variables
  - See bloom forecast under climate change scenarios

### 5. Applications Section
- [ ] Agriculture: Predict harvest readiness, detect diseases
- [ ] Public Health: Forecast pollen season, allergy alerts
- [ ] Conservation: Detect invasive species, monitor habitat shifts

### 6. Data Explorer Section
- [ ] Dataset Browser: MODIS, Landsat, VIIRS, PACE, GLOBE data
- [ ] Download Option: Export data (CSV/GeoJSON/NetCDF), visual snapshots
- [ ] API Access: Public endpoints for developers

### 7. Education & Storytelling Section
- [ ] Story Maps: Case studies (California Superbloom, climate impacts)
- [ ] Phenology Explainers: NDVI/EVI concepts, bloom importance
- [ ] Gamification: "Track Your Local Bloom" feature
