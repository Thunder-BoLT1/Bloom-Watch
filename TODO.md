# TODO: Integrate Real NASA Data into Dashboard with Layers, Charts, Analysis, and Time Animations

## Completed Steps:
1. [x] Update backend/fetch_nasa_data.py: Implement complete functions to fetch MODIS NDVI/EVI, SMAP soil moisture, GLDAS climate data for 2018-2024, and save to CSV files.
2. [x] Update backend/app.py: Add API endpoints to serve the fetched data (e.g., /api/ndvi, /api/soil_moisture, /api/climate) for dashboard consumption.
3. [x] Update src/Components/Map/Map.jsx: Add layer controls for NDVI (GeoJSON/raster overlay), soil moisture, bloom predictions, desertification risk. Implement time-based filtering for layers.
4. [x] Update src/Pages/Dashboard/Dashboard.jsx: Fetch data for multiple layers, add state management for layers and time. Connect time slider to filter map data by selected month/year. Implement play button for time animation (cycle through months/years).

## Pending Steps:
5. Add chart components: Create new components for NDVI trends, multi-year comparison, bloom cycle analysis, ecological insights using Chart.js or Recharts.
6. Integrate analysis: Use existing ML models (bloom_detection.py, desertification_model.py, forecasting_model.py) to generate predictions and display on map layers and charts.
7. Test the implementation: Run data fetching, verify CSV saving, test dashboard with real data, check layer switching, time slider, and play animation.
